## &#9741; &nbsp; Abstract

The main argument of this thesis is the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LM) in relation to its applications to neural networks. LM is an iterative algorithm, used for the solution of free optimization problems in the form of nonlinear least squares. This method usually finds applications in problems concerning the construction of a curve, or a function, which has the best correspondence with previously assigned
points.

In general, the algorithm aims to minimize the sum of squares
